Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.



>	$var1 = Get-Random -Minimum 25 -Maximum 51

Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.

>	$var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 11

Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.

>	$sum = $var1 + $var2

Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.


>	$sub = $var1 - $var2

Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.


>	$prod = $var1 * $var2

Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.


>	$quo = $var1 / $var2

Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:



"var1" + "var2" = "sum"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:



"var1" - "var2" = "sub"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:



"var1" * "var2" = "prod"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:



"var1" / "var2" = "quo"
